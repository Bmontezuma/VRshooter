## ***📌 Overview***
Zombie Shooter VR is a multiplayer virtual reality game developed by Brandon Montezuma and Collin Ballard as part of our capstone project in AR/VR development.

This game drops players into a post-apocalyptic world filled with swarms of zombies. Armed with VR weapons and survival instincts, players must fight together to survive increasingly intense waves of the undead.

We’re using Unity 6, Photon Fusion, and a wide range of modern development tools to create a polished and immersive shooter experience with multiplayer support.

Provide intuitive and satisfying VR gunplay using realistic reloading and physics.
Design tense and visually impactful zombie combat scenarios.
Create an efficient multiplayer lobby and spawning system using Photon Fusion.
Showcase industry-ready development skills in VR, networking, and gameplay systems.
